# -Real-State-Price-Prediction-Model-

The Real Estate Price Prediction Model project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts real estate property prices using historical data and various influential features. This project involves collecting comprehensive datasets from real estate listings, government databases, and market reports, followed by data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality. Key features influencing prices, such as location, property size, number of bedrooms, and proximity to amenities, are analyzed and selected for model training. Various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, are implemented and evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. The modelâ€™s predictions are visualized and presented through an intuitive user interface, allowing users to input property details and receive accurate price predictions. This tool assists buyers, sellers, agents, and investors in making informed real estate decisions.
